I have been writing code for over 10 years (mostly in Python). I am currently Director of Data and Analytics at [Gore Mutual](https://www.goremutual.ca/) and my key responsibility is to increase data-democratization and data-driven decision making. Before this, I was a Data Scientist at IBM Canada (Toronto) where I build Machine Learning models for clients in the Finacial Services sector. I joined IBM immediately after completing my M.Sc in Computer Science at University of Windsor. My area of research was Natural Language Processing.

I live in the [KWC Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Waterloo). Here is my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chux-ejieh-64b62970/) if you want to know more.

Everything in this blog is my personal opinion and should not be taken as the position of any employer, past or present.
