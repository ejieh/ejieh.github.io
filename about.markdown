Hi! I'm Chux and I'm currently of Director of Data Science and Analytics. I have a background in Machine Learning but these days I do more of data strategy, architecture and enabling companies unlock the value of data.

I currently live in the [KWC Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Municipality_of_Waterloo) even though I spent the first 2 decades of my life in [Ile Ife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If%E1%BA%B9) - a historic town. Here is my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chux-ejieh-64b62970/) if you want to know more.

This is my personal blog where I muse about anything - mostly data and every opinion should not be taken as the position of any employer, past or present.
